TMIM (Too Much Information Movies)

Project Goal:

The goal of this project is to provide relevent information on a movie or TV show typed in by the user. This project will also produce a list of top 100 movies/series recommendations that the user can also pull information on.

Why is something like this needed?

When you hear about a movie/show on TikTok or any other social media platform, you are usually not given that much information on the movie, AND you only hear of the movie from one POV. Also, a lot of the time, I become aware of movies and TV shows through fan edits, so I only see specific clips of the movie/show and don't get any real information on it.

This code will allow a user to type the name of a movie or TV show and get all the information on it (genre, actors, rated, languages, awards, plot, ratings, length, streaming options, etc.) to see if they actually want to watch it or not.

The 'pip install IMDbPY' allows me to access the content in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb)

I pulled this code -- along with some of the other code I used later on -- from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-imdbpy-getting-title-from-searched-movie/
